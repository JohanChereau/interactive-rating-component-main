## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM (Block, Element, Modifier)
- JavaScript

### What I learned

- I have discovered the CSS value `fit-content` to ensure that the size adapts to the content :

```css
  width: fit-content;
```

- A quick reminder about the form's radio buttons.

### Useful resources

- [MDN - fit-content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/fit-content) - MDN Documentation on fit-content.
